- Hello everyone 👋 I'm Ilya, junior coder🎯. 
- Education ⛔ shouldn't stop at college, and ⛔ shouldn't be restricted to institutions.
- That's why I never stop learning📘. 
- Now I keep on python and software development algorithms🧾.  

- My next goals:

  Python (basic) ✅
  
  SQL (basic) ✅
  
  Linux 🔍
  
  Django 🔍
  
  FastAPI
  
  Asyncio
  
  Python (advanced)
  
  Docker
  
- I'll glad to make new contacts and communications! 🤝

Text me on my 📧e-mail ilya.tyurin@hotmail.com or 📲TG: @valtesar.

- Hello everyone 👋 I'm Ilya, junior coder🎯. 
- Education ⛔ shouldn't stop at college, and ⛔ shouldn't be restricted to institutions.
- That's why I never stop learning📘. 
- Now I keep on python and software development algorithms🧾.  

- My next goals:

  ◻ Python (basic) ✅
  
  ◻ SQL (basic) ✅
  
  ◻ Linux 🔍
  
  ◻ Django 🔍
  
  ◻ FastAPI
  
  ◻ Asyncio
  
  ◻ Python (advanced)
  
  ◻ Docker
  
- I'll glad to make new contacts and communications! 🤝
